## Task: Model a multi-round discussion process to analyze a given Homophobic-Transphobic content and generate Counter Narrative to refute it based on the discussion.

## Participants and Roles
1. A Main Team of Five Members: Agent A, Agent B, Agent C, Agent D, Agent E.
- Stance: Oppose the Homophobic-Transphobic content;
- Objective: Discuss and collaborate to brainstorm and develop a proposal that outlines the comprehensive logical flow to effectively refute the Homophobic-Transphobic content.

2. A Critic
- Stance: Support the Homophobic-Transphobic content;
- Objective: Challenge the Main Team by identifying weaknesses in their discussion and debating their points.


## Additional Guidelines of Discussion
- The discussion should continue for multiple rounds until the Main Team is satisfied with their proposal and the Critic is persuaded.
- The discussion must involve rigorous and nonlinear reasoning, ensuring a persuasive and coherent logical flow.
- The discussion does not need to follow a strict order of participants but should prioritize the sequence of topics and sub-ideas to maintain a coherent progression of ideas.

Homophobic-Transphobic content: {input_text}

Now, simulate this discussion process given the Homophobic-Transphobic content:


Given csv file. It contains the fields : text, category, Agent_A, Agent_B, Agent_C, 	Agent_D, Agent_E. The text field contains Homophobic-Transphobic content, category contains the category to which the text field belongs to, the rest of the fields contain the counter speech generated by the Agents.

## Homophobic-Transphobic content: {Homophobic-Transphobic content}

##From the logical flow above

------------

## Task:
Write a coherent, persuasive and well-structured counter narrative sentences to refute the proposition based on the plan. You do not need to give more information. Just give one sentence in the counter narrative.
